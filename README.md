# Low-level programming & Algorithm
This repository contains programs written for the **Low-level programming** and **algorithm**; carried out during **Full Stack Software Engineering studies** at **[ALX AFRICA](https://www.alxafrica.com)**.

## Technologies
* Scripts written in Bash 5.1.16(1) release.
* C files are compiled using `gcc 11.2.0`.
* C files are written according to the C90 standard.
* Tested on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS.
