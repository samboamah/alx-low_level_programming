# Dynamic libraries
Project done during **Full Stack Software Engineering studies** at **[ALX AFRICA](https://www.alxafrica.com)**. It aims to learn about dynamic and shared libraries in **C language**.

## Technologies
* C files are compiled using `gcc 11.2.0.`
* C files are written according to the C90 standard
* Tested on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS.

## Files
All of the following files are scripts and programs written in C:

| Filename | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| `libholberton.s` | Dynamic library that contains many functions |
| `1-create_dynamic_lib.sh` | Shell script that creates a dynamic library |
| `100-operations.so` | Dynamic library that contains mathematical functions |
| `101-make_me_win.sh` | Shell script that injects a C program in order to hack `gm` executable file |
